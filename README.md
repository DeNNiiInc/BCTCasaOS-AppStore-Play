# CasaOS-AppStore-Play

🤪 The third-party CasaOS & ZimaOS app store also supports general *Docker Compose* deployment.
> **Note:** Some of the text below was AI translated from other languages to English and might not be 100% correct.

### Big thanks to the Upstream developer Cp0204, who has been maintaining the upstream app store for a long time.
Discover a vibrant third-party app store for CasaOS & ZimaOS, offering an extensive collection of unique and hard-to-find applications not available in the official AppStore. This repository celebrates niche, innovative apps and supports seamless multi-architecture deployments. Much of the foundation and ongoing improvements are thanks to the dedicated efforts of the incredible maintainers upstream—true community heroes whose work makes this ecosystem possible and, we hope, will continue to inspire for years to come.

<details>
<summary>Network Optimization for Mainland China</summary>

> After adding this software source to CasaOS, install the `dkTurbo` app and start it to apply the Docker image source with one click, solving the issue of being stuck (fail to pull images) when installing apps in China since 20240606.


```bash
# CasaOS Beginner Helper Script
# Switch DockerHub source, set proxy for docker pull, and other one-click functions
bash <(wget -qO- https://play.cuse.eu.org/casaos_newbie.sh)
```
</details>

## Features

 - Rich third-party applications
 - Use of the `:latest` tag 
 - Unsuitable for official AppStore
 - Niche Featured Apps
 - Support for Multi-arch & Fix armv7 [👇🏻](#arch-specific-source--)

> **Note:** This store app uses the `:latest` tag, so the `┆` check for updates function in the upper right corner of the app will be disabled, but **you can manually edit the app settings once (without changing anything) to get the latest image.** The good thing is that you can always get the latest version of the app even if the store source is unmaintained.

## Source link

```

```

This is just a generic version, please add the following sources corresponding to the architecture for best support if possible.


### Arm-specific Source
- **:warning: Please note that the ARM section is the work of the upstream developer Cp0204 https://github.com/Cp0204/CasaOS-AppStore-Play , and the following links are provided for convenience. If you have any issues with these sources, please contact the upstream developer.**

- **arm/armv7/armhf** (Wankeyun, etc.)

  Adds older versions of some applications that [LinuxServer has dropped support](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/a-farewell-to-arm-hf) for, and fixes an issue where the official app store fails to install and upgrade.

## TODO

The future direction of this repository is to transform into a general compose repository.

- [DONE] Remove all $AppID variables
- [Not Yet ] One-click script to select installed apps
- [No Plans Yet ] Adapt fields for dockge
